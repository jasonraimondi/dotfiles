# Modeling types

## Constructive modeling

Build the type from parts that are all legal instead of restricting a loose type with runtime checks. Adding is easier than subtracting.

Non-empty, via a variadic tuple:

```ts
type NonEmpty<T> = [T, ...T[]];

// Don't: T[] plus a length check every caller must repeat
function pickWinner(entries: string[]): string {
  if (entries.length === 0) throw new Error("no entries");
  return entries[Math.floor(Math.random() * entries.length)];
}

// Do: an empty value of the type can't exist
function pickWinner(entries: NonEmpty<string>): string {
  return entries[Math.floor(Math.random() * entries.length)];
}
```

Where a plain `T[]` arrives, narrow once with a guard. The fact then travels in the type:

```ts
const isNonEmpty = <T>(arr: T[]): arr is NonEmpty<T> => arr.length > 0;
```

Even length, as pairs. TypeScript has no refinement types (no `arr.length % 2 === 0` at the type level); you don't need one:

```ts
type Pairs<T> = [T, T][];
```

A time range, as start plus duration:

```ts
// Don't: a comment holds the invariant
type TimeRange = { start: Date; end: Date }; // start <= end

// Do: a negative range can't be written; derive end when needed
type TimeRange = { start: Date; durationMs: number };
```

Keep `durationMs` a plain number. Brand it (per Branded types) only if a raw number could be passed where a duration is expected, not by reflex. A `Pairs<T>` is an even-length list under the interpretation you give it, the same way `{ start, durationMs }` is a range. Pick the representation that makes the bad state unconstructable, then expose the reading you need on top (`pairs.flat()`, a `rangeEnd()` helper).

## Simplest total type

Don't strengthen everything. Keep `T[]` when every operation on it is total:

```ts
const sum = (xs: number[]) => xs.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); // [] is 0, fine
```

Strengthen when the loose type forces a lie at a use site. The tells are `!`, `arr[0] as T`, and a "should never happen" throw:

```ts
// Don't: partiality smuggled past the compiler
function newestSession(sessions: Session[]): Session {
  return sessions.at(0)!;
}

// Do: strengthen the input; the assertion disappears
function newestSession(sessions: NonEmpty<Session>): Session {
  return sessions[0];
}
```

Weakening the result to `Session | undefined` is the other total signature. Either way the empty case lands at the call site, the one place that knows what empty means.

## `unknown` over `any`

`any` disables type checking for everything it touches. External data is always `unknown`. Narrow before use.

```ts
// Don't
function handle(input: any) {
  return input.foo.bar;
}

// Do
function handle(input: unknown) {
  if (typeof input === "object" && input !== null && "foo" in input) {
    // narrowed; compiler verifies access
  }
}
```

External sources include RPC payloads, `JSON.parse`, `postMessage`, IPC, file contents, environment variables, database results.

## No `as` casts

Every `as` is a potential runtime crash. Cast only after the type system has verified the claim.

```ts
// Don't
const user = data as User;

// Do. Earn the cast at the boundary.
function parseUser(data: unknown): User {
  if (typeof data !== "object" || data === null) {
    throw new Error("expected object");
  }
  if (!("id" in data) || typeof (data as Record<string, unknown>).id !== "string") {
    throw new Error("expected id");
  }
  // ... validate all fields
  return data as User; // OK, earned cast after full validation
}
```

When refactoring an `as` out of existing code, identify why TypeScript can't infer:

- Missing discriminant: add one, switch to a discriminated union.
- Overly wide source type (e.g. `Record<string, unknown>`): narrow it.
- Untyped boundary: add a parse function or schema.
- Genuinely inexpressible: use a branded type or `satisfies`.

## `satisfies` over `as`

`satisfies` validates without widening literal types.

```ts
// Don't. Widens, loses literal types.
const config = { theme: "dark", cols: 3 } as Config;

// Do. Validates AND preserves literal types.
const config = { theme: "dark", cols: 3 } satisfies Config;
// config.theme is "dark" (literal), not string
```

## Boundary validation

Validate once where data crosses in; trust types inside.

- **Wire formats** (proto, JSON-RPC): parse with `ignoreUnknownFields` so forward-compatible changes don't break old clients.
- **Persisted JSON:** versioned blob with a try/catch around the parse.
- **Don't re-validate** deep in call chains.

## Object args

```ts
// Don't. Swap two args, still compiles.
openFile(uri, {
  startLineNumber: 10,
  startColumn: 1,
  endLineNumber: 10,
  endColumn: 1,
});

// Do. Order-independent, self-documenting.
openFile({
  uri,
  selection: {
    startLineNumber: 10,
    startColumn: 1,
    endLineNumber: 10,
    endColumn: 1,
  },
});
```

Skip on hot paths: per-frame render, tokenizers, parsers, anything in a tight loop where the allocation cost matters.
