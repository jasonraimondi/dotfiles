## Usage

Take a look at the [setup.sh](./setup.sh) script and give it a run.

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## GNU stow

[GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), or just `stow`, manages symbolic links from your dotfiles directory to the home directory.

To get stow on MacOS, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew install stow
```

Checkout this article for a more detailed explanation on using stow https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/

## zsh

The [~/.zshrc](zsh/dot-zshrc) imports our main entrypoint.

```bash
source "${HOME}/.zsh/_main.zsh"
```

The [~/.zsh/_main.zsh](zsh/dot-zsh/_main.zsh) file globs all zsh files in the `zsh/dot-zsh/*.zsh` directory and loads them.
