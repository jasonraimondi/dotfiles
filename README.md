## Stow

[GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), or just `stow`, manages symbolic links from your dotfiles directory to the home directory. To get stow on MacOS, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew install stow
```

We are utilizing the `--dotfiles` flag. This allows us to have folders with `dot-example` that will convert to `.example`. The following is from the stow manpage.

```
 --dotfiles

   Enable special handling for "dotfiles" (files or folders whose name
   begins with a period) in the package directory. If this option is
   enabled, Stow will add a preprocessing step for each file or folder
   whose name begins with "dot-", and replace the "dot-" prefix in the
   name by a period (.). This is useful when Stow is used to manage
   collections of dotfiles, to avoid having a package directory full of
   hidden files.

   For example, suppose we have a package containing two files,
   stow/dot-bashrc and stow/dot-emacs.d/init.el. With this option, Stow
   will create symlinks from .bashrc to stow/dot-bashrc and from
   .emacs.d/init.el to stow/dot-emacs.d/init.el. Any other files, whose
   name does not begin with "dot-", will be processed as usual.
```

## zsh

The [~/.zshrc](zsh/dot-zshrc) imports our main entrypoint.

```bash
source "${HOME}/.zsh/_main.zsh"
```

The [~/.zsh/_main.zsh](zsh/dot-zsh/_main.zsh) file globs all zsh files in the `zsh/dot-zsh/*.zsh` directory and loads them.

All file ending in `*.zsh` in the [~/.zsh](zsh/dot-zsh) directory will be sourced.
